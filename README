This is a generic test board for using ULN2803 and 74HC595 Shift Registers.
Useful while testing LED Displays or getting used to new micros :D

It has seperate power pins for darlington and shiftregisters.

If you drive an LED Display using it. Use Shift Register for posiive drive
and ULN2803 for negative drive.

You may need to add pnp transistor for +ve side since the source limit on 595 
is less. In that case you have to invert logic as well.

Hope its useful
